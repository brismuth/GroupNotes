When the user first comes to the site, they will be presented with the main page.  If the user is not logged in, they will be presented with a page that shows three text boxes, the first is so they can type in the university.  As they begin to type in a school, a suggestion box will come up and they will be able to select their school.

The second box is for the teacher.  As they begin to type in the teacher, a suggestion box will pop up and they will be able to select the teacher of their choice.  At the bottom of the suggestions will be "Add Teacher" in case their teacher is not provided.  If selected, a popup window will show asking them to type in the lastname and firstname of their teacher.  Once selected, the third box will provide a list of classes that that teacher is currently teaching with another choice of add class incase the class they are looking for is not available.  Once again, if chosen, that class will be added to the database and a new blank page will be found.

In addition, they will have the ability to login with a username and password found at the top right of the page.

A mockup of the landing page can be found at:

If they are logged in, then they will be presented with a different landing page.  This provides the functionality found on the above page in addition to a list of classes that they have previously visited for fast access to their classes.  A mockup of this page can be found at:
https://rawgithub.com/sixthsmith90/GroupNotes/master/pages/loggedin.html

Once the class of their choice has been found, they will be brought directly to the notetaking page where they can see in real time notes that are being taken as well as a class discussion on the notes.  Mockups of these can be found at:
https://rawgithub.com/sixthsmith90/GroupNotes/master/pages/notes/Note1.html

These pages will be accessable to view regardless of their login state.  However, to make any changes, the student must be logged in.  If they are not registered with the database, they can register by following a link at the top right of the page under "register".  A mockup of this page can be found at:
https://rawgithub.com/sixthsmith90/GroupNotes/master/pages/register.html

Finally, since all good sites have an about us and contact us links that can be found at the bottom of any page on the site, we have included these as well.  That way the student can know what they are accessing.  Mockups of these can be found at:
