GroupNotes
==========
GroupNotes is a revolutionary way to take and share class notes.  Tired of scrambling to takes notes on one concept while you miss an explination of the next?  Does the teacher go to fast to jot everything down?  While you are taking notes on one thing, Billy is jotting down info on the next.  Planning on being "sick" this Friday? No biggie! Just check out what Suzie wrote down from class, she's always there and always paying attention.

GroupNotes allows the students in a class to take notes together.  Notes are stored online and are written by and shared with everybody in class.  By working together, you can take more complete notes, and learn more.  And everything stored in one central location to be seen anytime.

With GroupNotes, no worries!
