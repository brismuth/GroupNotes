GroupNotes
==========
GroupNotes is a revolutionary way to take and share class notes.  Tired of scrambling to takes notes on one concept while you miss an explanation of the next?  Does the teacher go too fast to jot down everything?  While you are taking notes on one thing, Billy is jotting down the next.  Planning on being "sick" this Friday? No biggie! Just check out what Suzie wrote down from class, she's always there and always paying attention.

GroupNotes allows the students in a class to take notes together.  Notes are stored in the cloud and are written by and shared with everybody in class.  By working together, you can take more complete notes and learn more.  Thanks to cutting-edge cloud storage technologies, everything can be seen at any time.

With GroupNotes, no worries!
